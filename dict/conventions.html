	<p>The (1) <b>header</b> indicates the term under discussion. Orthodox forms are enclosed in lenticular brackets 【】, traditional forms are enclosed in white lenticular brackets 〖〗, and conditionally simplified forms are enclosed in square brackets []. Traditional forms are written in the Kangxi Dictionary form, except for certain distinctions that are to be kept. For example, the rams-horn component 卝 is written with four strokes, and the grass radical 艹 is written with three strokes rather than Kangxi's four.</p>
	<p>Characters are selected based on presence in the official printed font as well as one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wiktionary entry with English translation under the Chinese section OR entry in the </li>
		<li>Wiktionary entry with English translation anywhere AND entry in the </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Sino-Xenic Pronunciations</b> are given to the right of the header. These include (2) hangeul transcriptions, (3) orthographic representation using the native phonetic script, and (4) romanizations. Note that Korean romanization deviates from Revised Romanization by its treatment of vowels, which follows the McCune-Reischauer system instead; this is done in the interest of encouraging proper perception of vowels as monophthongs and not diphthongs by English speakers.</p>
