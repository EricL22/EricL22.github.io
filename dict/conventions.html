	<p>The (1) <b>header</b> indicates the term under discussion. Orthodox forms are enclosed in lenticular brackets 【】, traditional forms are enclosed in white lenticular brackets 〖〗, and conditionally simplified forms are enclosed in square brackets []. Traditional forms are written in the Kangxi Dictionary form, except for certain distinctions that are to be kept. For example, the rams-horn component 卝 is written with four strokes, and the grass radical 艹 is written with three strokes rather than Kangxi's four.</p>
	<p>Characters are selected based on presence in the official printed font as well as satisfaction of one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wiktionary entry with English translation under the Chinese section OR entry in the 牛津英汉汉英詞典</li>
		<li>Wiktionary entry with English translation anywhere AND entry in the 五南国語活用辞典</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Sino-Xenic Pronunciations</b> are given to the right of the header. These include (2) hangeul transcriptions, (3) orthographic representation using the native phonetic script (only applicable for Chinese and Japanese, as Korean is covered in (2) and Vietnamese is covered in (4)), and (4) romanizations. Note that Korean romanization deviates from Revised Romanization by its treatment of vowels, which follows the McCune-Reischauer system instead; this is done in the interest of encouraging proper perception of vowels as monophthongs and not diphthongs by English speakers.</p>
	<p>For brevity, only a single, most orthodox pronunciation is given for each entry; however, distinctions in meaning arising from changes in pronunciation are indicated (5). Pronunciations not directly attested or descended from Middle Chinese are <i>italicized</i>; this includes native Japanese <i>kun</i> readings, which are listed only in relevant compound words and never in individual characters.</p>
	<p>Where applicable, an (6) <b>interpretation</b> of the term follows. This is usually, though not always, an etymological explanation of the term. Any discrepancies between etymology and interpretation are therefore indicated.</p>
	<p>The <b>definition</b> follows the interpretation. This is self-explanatory.</p>
