	<h5>Entry Structure</h5>
	<p>The <b>header</b> indicates the term under discussion. Orthodox forms are enclosed in lenticular brackets 【】, traditional forms are enclosed in white lenticular brackets 〖〗, and conditionally simplified forms are enclosed in square brackets []. Traditional forms are written in the Kangxi Dictionary form, except for certain distinctions that are to be kept. For example, the rams-horn component 卝 is written with four strokes, and the grass radical 艹 is written with three strokes rather than Kangxi's four.</p>
