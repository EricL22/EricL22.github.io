    <h1>Han-Nom Converter</h1>
    <p>Enter Vietnamese text and get its representation in Han-Nom (Vietnamese-based Chinese characters).</p>
	<p>Historically, Vietnamese was written using a vast majority of phono-semantic compounds or phonetic borrowings. This is indicated as "phonetic" transcription below. A modern method, restricting the character set to the common-use Chinese characters, is modeled after the <i>kun</i> readings of Japanese Kanji and indicated as "semantic" transcription. As "traditional" Han-Nom characters were widely abbreviated, both methods of transcription use the modern simplification standard where applicable.</p>
    <p>Note that this is merely a conversion tool, not a translator, so lists of possible characters are presented where there is ambiguity. Onomatopoeic words are written in <a href="./hangeul.html#Vietnamese">Hang≈≠l</a>, and punctuation marks are not converted, mirroring the Korean practice.</p>
