    <h1>Han-Viet Converter</h1>
    <p>Input Traditional Chinese characters, and output a sentence of their Han-Viet readings. For the most part, this converter DOES NOT accept Simplified or Shinjitai character forms; you must convert them into Traditional forms first via another online converter before inputting them here. Support for input using the proper Orthodox forms will be added at a later date. Transcription into non-Sino-Vietnamese or native Vietnamese readings is also eventually planned.</p>
	<p>Note that characters that have not been determined as part of a compound word will display all of their possible Han-Viet readings (ex. 轉 -> chuyển/chuyến). This is done to facilitate readings of older texts, which often isolate and ambiguate these types of characters.</p>
    <p>Entering the grave accent ` will force capitalization of its immediate following character to indicate proper nouns (which would otherwise be impossible to distinguish), and will not print the accent itself in the output.</p>
