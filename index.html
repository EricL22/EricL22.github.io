    <h1>Hanzi Converters</h1>
    <p>Input Simplified or Xinjianti characters into these converters. Note that Simplified characters have a "default" traditional form on which they fall back when they have multiple definitions, so it is recommended to first convert these specific characters into the intended traditional form before inputting. <a href="https://fareast-english.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_New_Simplified_Forms_of_Chinese_Characters">Here is a list of traditional characters which the converter recognizes.</a></p>
